{"sections":["# How to work with TagRenderings\n\nThe information box shows various attributes of the selected feature in a human friendly way.\n\nThis is done by a **tagRendering** which converts attributes into text.\n\nThis can be done by using **predefined options** (mappings) or with a **render**-string\n","# Predefined options\n\nA predefined option states that, `if` a certain tag is present, `then` a certain text should be shown.\n\nFor example, a playground may be lit or not.\nIn OpenStreetMap, this is encoded with the tag `lit=yes` or `lit=no`. We might want to show `This playground is lit at night` and `This playground is not lit at night` to users of MapComplete.\n\nThis is what this will look like in the interface:\n\n<img class=\"w-1/2\" src=\"./assets/docs/PredefinedOption.png\"/>\n","# Substituting attributes\n\nIf none of the predefined options match, the string given in the `render`-field is used (under the question _\"What text should be rendered?\"_).\n\nA special property about all shown texts is that, **if the name of a key appears between braces, this will be replaced by the corresponding value**.\n\nFor example, if the object has tags `min_age=3` and the text to display is `Accessible to kids older than {min_age} years`, then this will be displayed to the user as **Accessible to kids older than 3 years**\n\nNote that this also works withing predifined options\n","# Special values\n\nSpecial components can be summoned by calling them. For example, the relevant wikipedia will be displayed by entering the text `{wikipedia()}`. A table with opening hours is displayed with `{opening_hours()}`. For a full reference, [see the documentation](https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete/blob/master/Docs/SpecialRenderings.md).\n","# Requesting data with predefined options\n\nThese renderings can be turned into a way to contribute data easily. If a **question** is provided, then these renderings will be asked if unknown or gain the pencil to make changes. \n\nA predefined option will show up as an option that can be picked.\n<img class=\"w-1/2\" src=\"./assets/docs/QuestionPredefinedOptions.png\"/>\n","# Requesting data with an input field\n\nIt is also possible to have a text field. For this, the **key** to write into must be given (_What is the name of the attribute that should be written to?_), in this case `max_age`.\n<img class=\"w-1/2\" src=\"./assets/docs/QuestionTextField.png\"/>\n","# Combining predefined options and freeform text\n\nA text field and predefined options can be combined. The contributor can then choose between a predefined option or filling out something.\n<img class=\"w-1/2\"  src=\"./assets/docs/QuestionCombined.png\"/>\n","# Selecting multiple values\n\nOne can set a question to allow multiple answers. This works with predefined options or a freeform text field.\n\n<img  class=\"w-1/2\" src=\"./assets/docs/QuestionMulti.png\"/>\n\nNote that these will be rendered as a list:\n\n<img class=\"w-1/2\" src=\"./assets/docs/RenderMulti.png\"/>\n"]}
