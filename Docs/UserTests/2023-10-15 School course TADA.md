# School course TADA

## Context

TADA (Toekomst Atelier/Atelier De L'avenir; literally: 'Workshops for the Future') is a program where young teens of underpriviliged areas are shown a series of professions in order to broaden their horizon.

As a part of this, pietervdvn and Thierry1030 were invited to give a course about (open) mapmapking.

Two groups (one of 12 kids, one of 10 kids) were first introduced to the concepts of map making, why maps are used and the cost of making them - even though the cost of _using_ map applications is often free. They were made aware of the business model of Google Maps (advertising). The data collection and privacy aspects proved to be very abstract and too difficult, so the second group was not confronted with this.

After this introduction, the pupils were divided into smaller groups of three or four each and were invited to go out and map a some objects in the neighbourhood.
Even though the attention of some waned, a few pupils were interested and answered a question or added a picture.

## Test setup

Some young teens with no particular tech background; but which can read maps
Testing medium: iPad (iOs) with Safari Browser

## Discovered usability issues

During this, the following usability issues surfaced:

- Clicking the map shows the 'add new icon'-button. This proved to be confusing, especially if another icon is directly below it. It was thus also unclear that this button should be pressed to add a new item.
- The 'geolocation' does not work on Safari
- The flow to add new images works well
- The flow to add opening hours and answer basic questions work well
