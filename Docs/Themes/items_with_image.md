 All items with images ( [items_with_image](https://mapcomplete.org/items_with_image) ) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



A map showing all items on OSM which have an image. This theme is a very bad fit for MapComplete as someone is not able to directly add a picture. However, this theme is mostly here to include this all into the database, which'll allow this to quickly fetch images nearby for other features

This theme contains the following layers:



  - [item_with_image](../Layers/item_with_image.md)
  - [selected_element](../Layers/selected_element.md)
  - [gps_location](../Layers/gps_location.md)
  - [gps_location_history](../Layers/gps_location_history.md)
  - [home_location](../Layers/home_location.md)
  - [gps_track](../Layers/gps_track.md)
  - [range](../Layers/range.md)
  - [last_click](../Layers/last_click.md)
  - [favourite](../Layers/favourite.md)
  - [summary](../Layers/summary.md)
